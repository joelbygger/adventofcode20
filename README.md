# What

Learning C# while solving AoC 2020.

This means my solution might not be most pretty, but use some feature I find interestin.

Also means I'm figuring out how VS behaves with folder structure.

To run tests, go to code filder and execute `dotnet test`.

Developed on Win, git managed via WSL, so line enidngs might be LF instead of CRLF in repo. I've not investigated how this works much. Modified git config core.autocrlf, first had it to `input` then changed to `true`.
